I'm giving a guest lecture in another class, so no lecture today. BUT, please do dedicate lecture time today to do the assigned React readings, and get started on [Lab 8](../assignments/lab08). Lab 8 is designed to be an extended tutorial that we'll be walking through and discussing in Wednesday's lecture and in Lab this week. 

The more you try and do on your own, the more you'll learn! I'll be happy to answer specific questions that you have about the lab on Wednesday, so come with questions.
