<img class="module-image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lectures/css.png" /> Today we are going to go over some of the core rules of CSS and practice some techniques for laying out web pages. I **absolutely recommend** that you review the LinkedIn Learning videos that are referenced in the supplemental materials. Whereas you can kind of wing it with HTML tags and look them up as needed, having a sense of how CSS works is essential to making professional-looking websites.
