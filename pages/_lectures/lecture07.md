For the next two weeks, we will be focusing on client-side web programming, where the **web browser** will be our interpreter. In today's lesson, we will review the three languages of client-side web programming -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will also go over the Document Object Model (DOM), including how to interact with it programmatically, using JavaScript. Finally, we will talk a bit about events and event handlers. 

If you are new to HTML, please complete the assigned LinkedIn Learning videos. Please also do the readings on the DOM and client-side JavaScript events.
