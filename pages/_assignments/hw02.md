## Part 1: Background Information

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> ### Readings
>
> Here are some recommended background readings to familiarize yourself with some of the concepts used in this lab:
>
> 1. <a href="https://medium.com/@anshul.vyas380/mvc-pattern-3b5366e60ce4" target="_blank">The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern</a>
> 2. <a href="https://javascript.info/promise-basics" target="_blank">How to use promises in JS</a> and <a href="https://javascript.info/promise-chaining" target="_blank">promise chaining</a>
> 3. <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html" target="_blank">Mongoose Queries</a>

In Homework 1, we built a _stateful web app_, where the server itself stores data and information about previous requests that are used to interact with the client. However, this is not good practice for real web applications. In real systems, there are often lots of different identical servers that a user can make requests to. If data is stored on the server, the system must route each user to the same server each time they make a request to keep their information consistent, which becomes a logistical nightmare (CS 310 and 345 cover scalable system architecture in more depth). Additionally, if a stateful application goes down (say, if the computer crashes), all the data that was stored on the server instance is lost forever.

To avoid these problems, we can create a _stateless_ application, in which no state is stored in the server. The solution to this problem is to use a _database_, which is a persistent data store that exists outside of the server. Web applications using REST typically use the Model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern, in which the user requests something from the controller (the server), which gets data from the model (the database), which is sent back to the controller and used to update the view (what you see on a web page).

<img class="small frame" src="/spring2021/assets/images/hw2/img1.png" alt="Diagram of the MVC design pattern. Arrows show information passing from the user to the controller to the model, then back to the controller and finally to the view."/>

The goal of this assignment is to turn the server you wrote in HW1 into a _stateless_ app, replacing the components that relied on the `data` object with database accesses. 

By handling the storage of all data in the database, rather than in a server instance, we can ensure that our API is stateless. The listed readings will help introduce you to:

1. The MVC design pattern and how it applies to web programming. For now, we will just be focusing on the Model and Controller aspects of the application; We will start discussing the View next week in class.
2. Promises, a common JS paradigm for asynchronous programming. For now, put the most focus on the sections on how to _use_ Promises, rather than how to create them (the introduction and the "Consumers: then, catch, finally" sections may prove useful).
3. How to query documents from a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

We recommend that you read through these resources somewhat thoroughly; Otherwise, this assignment could prove challenging. All Mongoose queries behave like Promises, so you should know how to use `.then()` to retrieve their results once executed.

## Part 2: Set Up Your Files

{:.blockquote-warning}
> ### Important Note
> 
> Some of the `hw02-cs396` files have changed since you completed **Lab 2**, namely:
> 1. All the files in the `config` directory, including:
>    * `config.js`
>    * `scripts/execPopulateDB.js`
>    * `scripts/populateDB.js`
> 1. The entire `test` directory
> 1. `package.json`


<a class="nu-button" href="/spring2021/course-files/assignments/hw02-cs396.zip?updated=1">hw02-cs396.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Give that some of the hw02-cs396.zip files have changed, please complete the following steps carefully:

1. Re-download hw02-cs396.zip. 
2. Copy the `config` and `test` directories and the `package.json` file from the `hw02-cs396` folder you **just unzipped** into the `hw02-cs396` folder that you **made during Lab 2**. Then delete the folder you just downloaded (to avoid confusion later).
   * Alternatively, you could also just start over with the new files, taking care to **keep the `.env` file you made in Lab 2**
3. Navigate to your `hw02-cs396` directory on the command line.
4. Run `npm install` again to install the node dependencies.
5. Run the database populate script again to ensure that your databse has been populated: `npm run populate`. This will run a script that will reset your database and fill it with the necessary data.
6. Finally, run your web server: `npm start`

### Verify your installation
To verify that you have successfully configured your web server:

#### 1. Check the /doctors and /companions endpoints
With your local web server running (don't forget to type `npm start`), please click on the following two links:

* Open [http://localhost:8081/doctors](http://localhost:8081/doctors) <br>It should show you doctors (but with different _ids)
* Open [http://localhost:8081/companions](http://localhost:8081/companions) <br> It should show you companions (but with different _ids)

#### 2. Run the tests npm test
Also with your local web server running, run the tests in a new command prompt / Terminal window: `npm test`. You should see feedback similar to the output below, with two tests passing (the /doctors and /companions GET endpoints) and 29 tests failing:

```bash
vanwars-macbook:hw02-cs396 vanwars$ npm test

> cs396@1.0.0 test

  /companions/crossover
    GET
      29) should show all companions that travelled with two or more doctors.


  2 passing (5s)
  29 failing
```

#### 3. Take a look at your MongoDB cloud database
We also recommend that you take a look at your database using the <a href="https://account.mongodb.com/account/login" target="_blank">MongoDB cluster on mongodb.com</a>. You can view your data in the `collections` tab of the cluster:

<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2021/assets/images/hw2/img2.png" alt="The MongoDB Cluster window with the 'collections' button highlighted."/>

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2021/assets/images/hw2/img3.png" alt="MongoDB collections window showing JSON-formatted data."/>

We have 2 collections in our database, one each for Doctor and Companion objects. Note that each object has a 24-character `_id`; These ids are generated automatically by MongoDB, so you don't need to create them for POST requests like in HW1 (in fact, you should never manually create or modify them for any reason).

### A note on tests this time around
There are a few important differences / notes regarding the mocha test suite this time around:
1. There are no longer endpoint dependencies.
  * In other words, you should be able to test any endpoint independently without also having to implement any other endpoints.  
2. Your tests will be interacting with your live database. 
  * In "the real world," automated tests should (a) make a copy of your database, (b) test everything using a copy of your DB, and then (c) destroy the copy after the tests run. However, in CS396, your tests will actually be doing create, read, update, and delete operations on your actual database.
3. Your tests will only work on **your web server**. 
  * Because the tests are now interacting with your own database (versus the static data.json file from hw01), your tests will only work on **your** local web server and **your** Heroku web server (because they both access the same database). 
  * Ask your peer mentor if you have any questions about this.

## Part 3: Your Assignment (13 Points)

Implement the Doctor Who API using the data located in your MongoDB cluster. Use the provided `Doctor` and `Companion` schema to query the database.

Let's walk through the first example together (you can test it using Postman the same way we did in Homework 1):

```javascript
router.route("/doctors")
    .get((req, res) => {
        console.log(`GET /doctors/${req.params.id}`);
        Doctor.find({})
            .then(data => {
                res.status(200).send(data);
            })
            .catch(err => {
                res.status(404).send(err);
            });
    })
```

In this example, we query the database for all `Doctor` documents and send them back to the client, sending an error instead if the query failed.
- `Doctor.find({})` performs a query for Doctor objects. The argument to `.find` is a JSON object containing search queries for objects you want to find. Since we pass in an empty object, all documents are returned.
- `.then(data => { ... })` follows the Promise syntax described in reading 2; For Mongoose queries, the callback passed to `.then()` takes a `data` object, which is a list of objects returned by the query.
- `res.status(200).send(data);` sends back the data to the client with a status code indicating that the GET request succeeded.
- `res.status(404).send(err);` is called if there is an error while querying MongoDB (e.g. if the connection is broken). In this case, we send back an error message with a status code indicating that the requested resource couldn't be found.

### Sample code
We went over some different ways of formulating MongoDB queries in [Lecture 5](../lectures/lecture05) (see code samples, including the `samples.js` file and the `answers` folder). There are also some useful links to the MongoDB documentation in Lecture 5, for your reference.

### Your tasks
The specifications for the API routes are the <a href="hw01#routes">same as in HW1</a>, but should use and modify database data (instead of a local JavaScript Object). If your API works correctly, you should see the same responses as you did in Homework 1 (except different `_id` values and a new `__v` property).

__Note__: The extra credit system for the first assignment (where a user can add and remove favorite characters) is _required_ for this assignment and will count for 3 points. You should also upload your app to Heroku and submit its link along with your assignment.


## Part 4: Deploy your app to Heroku (2 Points)
You will deploy your app to Heroku in the same way as you did in HW1. This includes:

1. Making a new GitHub repo (see [Lab1 instructions](/spring2021/assignments/lab01#cs397_configure-your-github-repository))
2. Committing all of your HW2 files to your new GitHub repo
3. Deploying your app to Heroku (see [HW1 instructions](/spring2021/assignments/hw01#cs397_4-deploying-to-heroku))

However, since we're now using a cloud database (on the MongoDB server), there is one additional step: 

#### Setting up your database connection on Heroku
Since `.env` is not tracked by Git (because it's in the .gitignore file), we have to let Heroku know the values of our environment variables so the app will work once deployed. 

To do this, open your Heroku dashboard and navigate to the Settings tab. Click "Reveal Config Vars" and add in the key-value pairs for each of the variables in your `.env` file.

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2021/assets/images/lab02/heroku_env.png"/>

When you're done, you can test that you're successful by navigating to the posts endpoint.


## What to Turn In

We have provided a testing script for you to use to debug your program, which is the same script we will be using to grade your code. To run the tests, open a second terminal window to the `cs396_api` directory __while your server is running__ and type `npm test`.

We will also be checking to make sure that all your routes query MongoDB; using the `data` object instead of the database will result in 0 points for that question.

When you're done, upload your completed `routes.js` file to Canvas and a link to your Heroku app. Make sure to upload the file by Tuesday night at midnight. Please be careful that you __don't just upload the original starter file__ (or your HW1 submission!), and that you submit __YOUR CODE__.
